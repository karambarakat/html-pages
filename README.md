# HTML Portfolio Items

these are some small html, css and sass project I created in the beginnings of my learning to web development back in 2021/2020.

most of them are 450 to 600 line of html code with no template engine or framework.

later I decided to use ExpressJS, Gulp and Handlebars template engine you can find that project [here](https://github.com/karambarakat/gulp-project).

## Live Preview

this is todo task, I used to use Heroku with that Express/Gulp project but now it's been taken down.

## Languages and Framworks

I used these tools:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- sometimes Bootstrap or MaterialCSS
- Customized with my own SASS
